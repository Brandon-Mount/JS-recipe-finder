Overview

For this project, I built a Recipe Finder to practice and improve my JavaScript skills. The goal was to work with real data, write cleaner code, and better understand how JavaScript programs are structured.

The software is a Node.js Recipe Finder that lets users enter ingredients in the terminal and then searches for recipes that use those ingredients. It pulls recipe data from a public API and displays matching results. The program also checks for errors so it runs smoothly.

I wrote this software to practice JavaScript basics like arrays, functions, recursion, and error handling, as well as using a third-party library.

Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write the code and Node.js to run the program. I also used npm to manage the project dependencies.

The programming language used was JavaScript, and the project uses the axios library to access recipe data.
